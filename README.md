# CountryPedia-2.0
React remake of my first JavaScript project that was written in Vanilla js. Now with some new features and updated styling âœ¨.

The project is built using an API consisting of information about 250 countries. So fasten your seatbelts and get ready for a tour around the world!

#### This is a work in progress, here's what's next:
- Make Capital Quest game
- Add counter for flag quiz (maybe add 3 strikes?)
- Better loading
- Add navigation on games page
