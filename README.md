# CountryPedia-2.0

A React remake of my first JavaScript project, originally written in Vanilla JS. Now with new features and updated styling! ‚ú®

The project is built using an API that provides information about 250 countries. So fasten your seatbelts and get ready for a tour around the world!

### This is a work in progress. Here's what's next:
- Create the Capital Quest game
- Add a counter for the flag quiz (maybe include 3 strikes?)
- Improve loading
- Implement navigation on the game pages
